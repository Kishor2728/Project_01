                A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for
                the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of
                formal education, which is commonly compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series
                of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but
                generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have
                completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a
                university college or university, but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory.
                In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after
                primary (Elementary in the US) and secondary (Middle school in the US) education. Kindergarten or
                preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3â€“5). University, vocational
                school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one
                particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance. Alternative schools may provide
                nontraditional curriculum and methods.
